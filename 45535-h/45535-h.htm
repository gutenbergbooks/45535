<h1 title="">MESA VERDE
<br /><i>National Park</i></h1>
<hr />
<p class="center">&middot; SEASON FROM MAY 15 TO OCTOBER 15 &middot;</p>
<hr />
<p>The mesa verde, or green mesa, so-called because its juniper and
pi&ntilde;on trees give it a verdant tone, is 15 miles long by 8 miles wide.
Rising abruptly from the valley on the north side, its top slopes
gradually southward to the high cliffs bordering the valley of the Mancos
River on the south. Into this valley open a number of large high-walled
canyons through which occasionally, in times of heavy rain, raging torrents
of water flow into the Mancos. In the shelter of the caves that have been
eroded in the sides of these canyons are some of the best-preserved cliff
dwellings in America, built many centuries ago by a tribe of peace-loving
Indians who prized the security offered by the almost inaccessible caves.
In order to preserve these cliff dwellings Mesa Verde National Park was
created, but they are not the only attractions in the area. In the winter
the park is closed to travel by deep snow, but in the early spring the blanket
of snow is replaced by a mantle of flowers that change with the seasons,
and to the story of the prehistoric inhabitants is added an absorbing story
of nature that is peculiar to this mesa and canyon country.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Mesa Verde region&rdquo;, writes Arthur Chapman, &ldquo;has many attractions
besides its ruins. It is a land of weird beauty. The canyons which
seam the mesa, all of which lead toward the distant Mancos River, are, in
many cases, replicas of the Grand Canyon of the Colorado. While the
summer days are warm, the nights are cool, and the visitor should bring
plenty of wraps besides the clothing and shoes necessary for the work of
climbing around among the trails. It is a country for active footwork,
just as it was in the days of the cliff dwellers themselves. But when one
has spent a few days among the cedars and pi&ntilde;on pines of the Mesa Verde,
well named Green Table by the Spaniards of early days, he becomes an
enthusiast and will be found among those who return again and again to
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
this most unique of national parks to study its mysteries and its beauties
from all angles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The northern edge of the mesa terminates in a precipitous bluff, averaging
2,000 feet above the Montezuma Valley. The general slope of the
surface is to the south, and as the main road to the ruins meanders back
and forth in heading each smaller canyon, many times skirting the very
brink of the great northern fault line, tremendous expanses of diversified
terrain are brought into view, first in Colorado and Utah, then in Arizona
and New Mexico.</p>
<p>A new scenic road approximately 1 mile in length branches from the
main highway at a point 8 miles beyond the entrance checking station and
ascends to the crest of Park Point, the highest part of the Mesa Verde
National Park, which attains an elevation of 8,575 feet above sea level.</p>
<p>From this majestic prominence the great Montezuma Valley, dotted with
artificial lakes and fertile fields, appears as from an airplane, while to the
north are seen the Rico Mountains and the Lone Cone of Colorado, and to
the east, the La Plata Mountains. To the west the La Sals, the Blues, and
Bears Ears, of Utah, dominate the horizon. Some of these landmarks are
more than 115 miles distant. Southward numerous deep canyons, in which
the more important cliff dwellings are found, subdivide the Mesa Verde
into many long, narrow, tonguelike mesas. The dark purplish canyon of
the Mancos River is visible in the middle foreground, and beyond, above
the jagged outline of the mesa to the south, the Navajo Reservation, surrounded
by the deep-blue Carrizos of Arizona and the Lukachukai and
Tunichas of New Mexico.</p>
<p>In the midst of this great mountain-enclosed, sandy plain, which, seen
from the mesa, resembles a vast inland sea surrounded by dark, forbidding
mountains, rises Ship Rock (45 miles distant), a great, jagged shaft of
igneous rock, 1,860 feet high, which appears for all the world like a great
&ldquo;windjammer&rdquo; under full sail. Toward evening the illusion is perfect.</p>
<p>The distance from Park Point to Spruce Tree Camp, the park headquarters,
is 12 miles. The entire road from the park entrance to headquarters,
20 miles, is gravel surfaced and oil treated, full double width,
and cars may pass at any point thereon.</p>
<p>Although there are hundreds of cliff dwellings within the Mesa Verde
National Park, the more important are located in Rock, Long, Wickiup,
Navajo, Spruce, Soda, Moccasin, and tributary canyons. Surface ruins of
a different type are widely distributed over the narrow mesas separating
the numerous canyons. A vast area surrounding the park contains more or
less important ruins of these early inhabitants, most important and easiest
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
of access from the park being the Aztec Ruins and Chaco Canyon National
Monuments, New Mexico; the Yucca House National Monument, Colorado;
and the Hovenweep National Monument, Colorado-Utah.</p>

<h2 id="c1"><br /><span class="small">THE RUINS</span></h2>
<p>Although the Spaniards were in the Mesa Verde region as early as
1765 and the Americans as early as 1859, it was not until 1872 that the
first settlement was made. In that year the Mancos Valley, lying at the
foot of the Mesa Verde, was settled, but because of the fact that the mesa
itself was a stronghold of the warlike Ute Indians, many years passed
before the cliff dwellings were discovered.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">[5]</div>
<p>The ruins in the Mancos Canyon were discovered as early as 1874 when
W. H. Jackson, who led a Government party, found there many small
dwellings broken down by the weather. The next year he was followed
by Prof. W. H. Holmes, later chief of the Bureau of American Ethnology,
who drew attention to the remarkable stone towers also found in this
region. Had either of the explorers followed up the side canyons of the
Mancos they would have then discovered ruins which, in the words of
Baron Gustav Nordenski&ouml;ld, the talented Swedish explorer, are &ldquo;so magnificent
that they surpass anything of the kind known in the United States.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The largest cliff ruin, known as Cliff Palace, was discovered by Richard
Wetherill and Charlie Mason while hunting cattle one December day in
1888. Coming to the edge of a small canyon they first caught sight of a
village under the overhanging cliff on the opposite side, placed like a picture
in its rocky frame. In their enthusiasm they thought it was a palace.
With the same enthusiasm the visitors of today involuntarily express their
pleasure and surprise as the spectacle breaks on their astonished vision.</p>
<p>Later these two men explored this ruin and gave it the name of Cliff
Palace, an unfortunate designation, for it is in no respect a palace, but a
community house, containing over 200 living rooms, former abodes of
families, and 23 ceremonial rooms or kivas. They also discovered other
community dwellings, one of which was called Spruce Tree House, from a
large spruce tree, since cut down, growing in front of it. This had 8
ceremonial rooms and probably housed 300 inhabitants.</p>
<p>The findings of these two ruins did not complete the discoveries of
ancient buildings in the Mesa Verde; many other ruins were found by
the Wetherills, and others who need not now be mentioned. They mark
the oldest and most congested region of the park, but the whole number of
archeological sites may reach into the thousands.</p>
<p>Only a few of the different types of ruins that have already been excavated
and repaired and are now accessible to the visitor are considered herein.
This excavation and repair was the work of the late Dr. J. Walter Fewkes,
formerly chief of the Bureau of American Ethnology, with the exception
of Balcony House, which was done by Jesse L. Nusbaum. Hundreds of
sites await scientific investigation, being accessible now only on foot or
horseback mainly by means of trails.</p>
<h3 id="c2">SPRUCE TREE HOUSE</h3>
<p>Spruce Tree House, located in a large cave just across Spruce Tree
Canyon from the museum, has been made readily accessible by a short
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
winding trail. This is the only excavated cliff dwelling in the park that
may be visited without going on a conducted tour, and is open to the public
at all times. A ranger is always on duty to protect the ruin from vandalism
and to give information to the visitors.</p>
<p class="center">GENERAL DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>The total length of Spruce Tree House is 216 feet, and its greatest width
is 89 feet. During the excavation of the ruin in 1907, Dr. Fewkes counted
8 ceremonial rooms, or kivas, and 114 rooms that had been used for
living, storage, and other purposes. At least 14 seemed to have been
storage and burial rooms so that probably not more than 100 were used as
dwellings. If it is considered that a family occupied each room, the population
would have been large, but it is doubtful if all of the rooms were
occupied at one time. An average of 2 or 3 persons to the room, making
a total of not more than 300 for the entire village, would no doubt be a
fair estimate.</p>
<p>Two hundred feet north of Spruce Tree House the canyon comes to an
abrupt box end. A splendid spring flows from the base of the sandstone
cliff, and it was to this spring that the cliff-dweller women went for water
carrying it back to their homes in their big water jars. At the south end
of the cave a trail, consisting of small toeholds cut in the cliff, led to the
mesa top above. This trail was used by the men as they went to their
mesa-top fields, where they raised corn, beans, and squash, and by the
hunters as they went in search of deer and mountain sheep that lived in
the forests above.</p>
<p class="center">LIVING ROOMS</p>
<p>The rooms of Spruce Tree House are divided into two groups by a
court or street running from the front to the back of the cave, at a point
just south of the center of the village. The majority of the rooms are north
of this street, and some of the walls show the finest work in the entire
structure. The stones were well shaped and smoothed; the mud mortar
was carefully worked into the crevices and compressed with thin stone
wedges. Over many of the walls was spread a thin coat of reddish plaster,
often decorated with paintings. These rooms, standing as when they were
constructed 700 years ago, are mute evidence of the cleverness of the masons
who built them.</p>
<p>Spruce Tree House has more walls that reach the top of the cave than
any other ruin in the park. All through the central part the walls were
three stories high and the top of the cave served as the roof of the upper
rooms. The first- and second-story rooms, however, had their own ceilings.
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
Heavy rafters, running lengthwise of the rooms, were covered with a
crosswise layer of small poles and withes, and these in turn were covered
with a 3-inch layer of mud. Very often a small hatchway was left in one
corner of the ceiling and a short ladder leaning in the corner of the lower
room gave access to the room above.</p>
<p>Very few of the houses were equipped with fire pits. Most of the cooking
was done in the open courts and the small fire pits can be found along the
walls and in the corners of the courts and passageways.</p>
<p class="center">CEREMONIAL ROOMS OR KIVAS</p>
<p>Spruce Tree House has eight of the circular, subterranean rooms that
were set aside for ceremonial purposes. Similar rooms are still in use in
the present day Pueblo Indian villages and are known as kivas.</p>
<p>Usually the kiva roofs have collapsed, but in Square Tower House two
kivas have the original roofs almost intact. Following the plan of these
original roofs, three of the kivas in Spruce Tree House have been reroofed
and upon descending the ladder into one of these the details of construction
may be noted.</p>
<p>Kivas in the Mesa Verde are always underground and are nearly always
circular. The average diameter is 12 to 13 feet and the depth is such that
the roof would clear a man&rsquo;s head. At a point about 3 feet above the floor
is a narrow ledge running entirely around the room. This ledge is known
as the banquette and its exact use is unknown. On this ledge were built
six stone buttresses or pilasters, and these, rising to within 2 or 3 feet of the
top of the kiva, served as roof supports. Short beams were placed from
pilaster to pilaster around the room and a second set of beams was laid
across the angles made by the first set. This was continued until five or six
sets of beams had extended this cribwork almost to the ground level. Horizontal
beams were then placed across the top and the whole structure was
covered with bark and earth. In the center of the roof a small square
hole was left that served as a door and smoke vent.</p>
<p>On the south side of the kiva the banquette is wider between two of the
pilasters than anywhere else around the room. This deep recess is often
referred to as an altar, although its exact use is not known. Just back of
the wall of this deep recess is a vertical shaft that leads down to meet a
horizontal shaft that opens into the kiva just above the floor. This is the
ventilator shaft. The fire, burning in the small pit in the center of the
room, sent the smoke up through the hole in the roof, and the fresh air was
drawn down through the ventilator shaft. Between the ventilator and the
fire pit a small wall, known as the &ldquo;deflector&rdquo;, was constructed to keep
the fresh air current from blowing on the fire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">[8]</div>
<p>Two or three feet from the fire pit, and in a straight line with the ventilator
shaft, the deep recess, the deflector and the fire pit is a small hole in the
floor of the kiva. This hole is usually about 3 inches in diameter and from
4 to 6 inches deep; its walls and bottom often covered with a smooth layer
of mud. In the present day kivas this hole is known as the &ldquo;sipapu&rdquo;,
and is considered to be the symbolic entrance to the underworld. The
kiva was a combination ceremonial, club, and workroom for the men.
Even in the present day villages the women are rarely ever allowed to
enter the kivas because of the fact that the men take almost entire charge
of the religious work. It is believed that each clan had its own kiva, and it
will be noted that in almost every case the kiva is surrounded by a group of
living rooms. The members of the clan no doubt lived in these rooms and
the men held their ceremonies in the adjoining kiva. Two of the kivas in
Spruce Tree House have side entrances that lead to nearby rooms. These
rooms may have been the homes of the priests, or dressing rooms for them.</p>
<p class="center">DATE OF OCCUPATION</p>
<p>Twenty-one of the roof beams in Spruce Tree House have been dated by
tree-ring chronology. These dates show that the houses were constructed
during the years between 1230 A. D. and 1274 A. D. In 1276 A. D. a
23-year period of drought began that caused the cliff dwellers to move to
regions where there was a more permanent supply of water. In those same
regions are the homes of the modern Pueblo Indians and no doubt some of
these people are the descendants of the Cliff Dwellers.</p>
<h3 id="c3">CLIFF PALACE</h3>
<p>Cliff Palace lies in an eastern spur of Cliff Canyon under the roof of an
enormous cave that arches 50 to 100 feet above it. The floor of the cave is
elevated about 200 feet above the bottom of the canyon and is just under
the rim of the mesa. The entrance of the cave faces west, toward a great
promontory upon which stands Sun Temple.</p>
<p>The total length of the cave is over 300 feet and its greatest depth is just
under 100 feet. The vaulted roof is so high that the cave was always light
and airy and offered a perfect home site to the cliff dwellers who were
seeking protection from the elements as well as from their enemies.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the configuration of the cliffs above the ruin makes it
possible to get a fine birdseye view from the rim of the mesa. Views
obtained from the heads of the two trails are most striking and give an
idea of the setting and size of the building before it is entered for closer
inspection. The most spectacular view of Cliff Palace is from Sun Temple,
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
across the canyon. This is the only spot from which the entire ruin may
be seen.</p>
<p class="center">LIVING ROOMS</p>
<p>Cliff Palace is the largest known cliff dwelling. Dr. Fewkes, who
excavated the ruin in 1909, placed the number of living rooms at slightly
more than 200. Very few of the walls reached the top of the cave because
of its great height, but many of the structures were as high as two and
three stories. Near the south end of the ruin is the tallest structure, a
four-story tower that reaches the cave roof. Ground space appropriate for
building purposes was at a premium in the cave. To provide for an increasing
population, second, third, and even fourth-story rooms were superimposed
on the original single-story structures which predominated in the
initial cliff-dweller occupation of this site.</p>
<p>When the cliff dwellers started building in the cave they were confronted
with the problem of an uneven floor. The floor of the cave slanted
from the back to the front and was covered with huge, angular boulders that
had fallen from the cave roof. This problem the cliff dweller solved by
erecting terraces and filling in the irregular places. The open spaces
between the boulders were excellent for kivas, as there was not a great
deal of excavation necessary. After the kiva walls were built the extra
space was filled in with trash and dirt. When the flat kiva roof was added
a level court resulted. Around this court the homes were constructed,
often on the rough surfaces of the big boulders. Because of the uneven
floor and the terracing that was necessary, six distinct terrace levels resulted.</p>
<p class="center">KIVAS</p>
<p>Twenty-two kivas are located in the cave and another, lying about 50
feet from the western end, and thought to have been used by men living
in the cave, brings the total to 23. Twenty of these conform to the plan
of the typical Mesa Verde kiva, but three seem to be of a different type.
These three, instead of being round, are square with rounded corners.
The banquette is missing as well as the pilasters or roof supports.</p>
<p class="center">STORAGE ROOMS</p>
<p>Because of the fact that the inhabitants of Cliff Palace were forced to
store enough corn each fall to last until the next harvest a great many
storage rooms were constructed. Any small nook or cranny that was too
small for a home was utilized for that purpose. Far back in the cave a
number were constructed of large, thin sandstone slabs. These slabs were
placed on end to form small rectangular rooms, and when the door slabs
were in place and all of the crevices were well chinked with mud the grain
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
was safe from the rodents. High up under the roof of the cave, at the
back, was a long narrow shelf that was also utilized for storage space.
A wall was built along the front of the ledge, closing it up completely,
and the space back of the wall was divided into 14 small storage rooms.
A ladder on the roof of one of the houses below gave access to the ledge.</p>
<p class="center">PAINTINGS</p>
<p>In the third floor room of the four-story tower is the finest painting yet
found in the Mesa Verde. The entire inner surface of the four walls was
covered with bright red designs on a white background. The designs are
similar to those found on cliff-dweller pottery. The white color was
obtained by mixing finely ground gypsum with water to form a smooth
paste; the red was obtained by treating hematite, or red ochre, in the same
manner.</p>
<p class="center">THE ROUND TOWER</p>
<p>The outstanding structure in Cliff Palace is the two-story round tower
that stands just south of the center of the cave. Every stone in this tower
is rounded to conform to the curvature of the walls and the graceful taper
toward the top makes it one of the finest examples of masonry work in the
region. When the early explorers first entered this tower the only object
found was the most beautiful stone ax they ever discovered. Whether
this tower was a home or whether it was constructed for some special purpose
can only be conjectured.</p>
<p class="center">POSSIBLE POPULATION</p>
<p>Because of the fact that Cliff Palace is the largest of all cliff dwellings,
its population is of special interest. A close inspection of the rooms in the
ruin shows that they are smaller, on the average, than the rooms in any
of the other large cliff dwellings. When judged from our modern
standards, it is difficult to imagine more than a couple of people living in
each one. Our modern ideas, however, will not help us in understanding
the people who once lived in Cliff Palace.</p>
<p>More than anything else the cliff dwellers desired security from their
enemies. Their next desire was safety from the elements. When it is
considered that these were the motivating influences, it can easily be
understood that such minor matters as space and comfort would receive
little consideration. Since the inhabitants were an easy-going, peace-loving
group it can be imagined that crowded living conditions would not be
objectionable. In addition it must be considered that the rooms were
used principally as sleeping quarters. All activities were carried on in
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
the open courts and on the terraced roof tops. Even the cooking was done
over open fires outside the houses.</p>
<p>An average of two to the room would give a population of 400; an average
of three would place 600 in the cave. If every room were occupied at one
time and if the average of two or three to the room is not too high, it
would seem that a total population of 500 would not be too great for Cliff
Palace.</p>
<h3 id="c4">BALCONY HOUSE</h3>
<p>Balcony House lies in Soda Canyon about 2&frac12; miles southeast of Spruce
Tree Camp, and is reached by a continuation of the Cliff Palace Road. It
is one of the most picturesque of the accessible ruins in the park and occupies
a better position for defense than most of the other ruins on the mesa. A few
defenders could have repelled a numerous attacking force. Additional precautions
have been taken at the south end of the ruin for the strengthening
of its defenses, where the only means of reaching it is through a very narrow
cleft. The south part of the ledge was walled up to a height of about 15 feet,
the lower part of the wall closing the cleft being pierced by a narrow tunnel.
Through this tunnel a man may creep on hands and knees from the cliff
dwelling to the south part of the ledge, which affords a footing, with a precipice
to the left and the cliff to the right, for about 100 paces. The ledge here
terminates in the perpendicular wall of the canyon. The ruined walls of a
strong tower, built to cut off approach on this side, may still be traced. At
the north end of the ruin the foundation gave the builders considerable
trouble, but the difficulties were skillfully overcome. A supporting wall was
erected on a lower ledge, to form a stable foundation for the outer wall of
the upper rooms, where the higher ledge was too narrow or too rough for
building purposes.</p>
<p>South of the rooms fronted by this wall is a small open court, bounded at
the back by a few very regular and well-preserved walls which rise to the
roof of the cave. The poles supporting the floors of these upper-story
rooms project about 2 feet to provide support for a balcony. Split poles,
laid parallel with the front wall, were covered at right angles with rods of
cedar bast and generously plastered with clay to form the floor of the
balcony, which served as a means of outside communication between the
rooms of the upper story. A low, thick parapet wall built on the edge of
the precipice encloses the outer side of the northern court.</p>
<p>The funds for the excavation and repair of Balcony House in 1911
were largely furnished by the Colorado Cliff Dwellers Society, an organization
founded and directed by Mrs. Gilbert McClurg, of Colorado
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
Springs, Colo., for the original purpose of stimulating interest in legislation
for the preservation and protection of the prehistoric remains of the Mesa
Verde, which led to the creation of this national park in 1906.</p>
<h3 id="c5">SQUARE TOWER HOUSE</h3>
<p>Square Tower House is situated in an eastern spur of Navajo Canyon
nearly opposite a great bluff called Echo Cliff. An ancient approach to the
ruin was from the canyon rim. It was used by the natives, but is almost
impassable for white visitors. Foot holes for ascent and descent had been
cut by the Indians in the cliff at a point south of the ruin which enabled
them to reach the level on which the ruin is situated. Along the top of the
talus there runs to the ruins a pathway which splits into an upper and
a lower branch. The former, hugging the cliff, passes through the &ldquo;Eye
of the Needle&rdquo;; the latter is lower down on the cliff.</p>
<p>The Square Tower House cave is shallow, its rear perpendicular, with
roof slightly overhanging. At the extreme eastern end of the ruin the
vertical face of the cliff suddenly turns at right angles, forming an angle in
which, high above the main ruin, there still remain walls of rooms. To
these rooms, which are tucked away just under the canyon rim, with only
their front walls visible, the name &ldquo;Crow&rsquo;s Nest&rdquo; is given. One end of a
log, extending from a wall of one of these rooms, rests in a hole cut in the
side of the cliff, a well-known method of cliff-house construction.</p>
<p>Some rooms in Square Tower House were devoted to secular, others to
ceremonial purposes. The former have angular corners; the latter are
circular. The rectangular rooms were constructed above ground; the circular
were subterranean. These rooms do not differ radically from those
of Spruce Tree House and other cliff dwellings. They have similar windows,
door openings, and supports of balconies. There is little difference in
the size of the stones used in the masonry at different heights. The absence
of a cave recess in the rear of the building is significant, as it allowed the cliff
to be used as the back wall of the rooms.</p>
<p>Square Tower House measures about 138 feet from its eastern to its
western end. There are no streets or passageways as at Spruce Tree
House and Cliff Palace, and no open spaces except on the kiva roofs.
The rooms are continuous and compactly constructed. Excepting the
spaces above the kivas, the walls are united from one end of the cave to
the other. The foundations of the secular rooms are constructed on two
levels, an upper and a lower. These rooms occupy the intervals between
the kivas, never in front of them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</div>
<p class="center">THE TOWER</p>
<p>The tower is, of course, the most conspicuous as well as the most interesting
architectural feature of the ruin, being visible for a long distance as
one approaches Square Tower House. Its foundation rests on a large
boulder situated in the eastern section of the cave floor. This tower has
three walls constructed of masonry, the fourth being the perpendicular rear
wall of the cave. The masonry of the tower stands about 35 feet above the
foundation, but the foundation boulder on which it stands increases its
height over 5 feet.</p>
<p>On a projecting rock on the west side above the tower is the wall of a
small, inaccessible room which may have been used as a lookout or as an
eagle house.</p>
<p>The lowest story of the tower is entered from plaza B, and on the east side
there are three openings, situated one over another, indicating the first,
second, and third stories, but on the south side of the tower there are only
two doorways. The roof of the lowest room is practically intact, showing
good workmanship, but about half of its floor is destroyed. The upper walls
of the second-story room have the original plaster, reddish dado below and
white above. Although the third and fourth stories are destitute of floors,
they are plastered.</p>
<p class="center">KIVAS</p>
<p>Some of the best preserved circular ceremonial chambers (kivas) in the
Southwest are to be seen in Square Tower House. The majority of the
kivas belong to the pure type, distinguished by mural pilasters supporting
a vaulted roof.</p>
<p>Kiva A is particularly instructive on account of the good preservation of
its roof. Its greatest diameter is 13 feet 6 inches; or, measuring inside the
banquettes, 11 feet 1 inch. The interior is well plastered with many
layers of brown plaster. The pilasters are six in number, one of which is
double. Two depressions are visible in the smooth floor, in addition to a
fireplace and a sipap&ucirc;. These suggest ends of a ladder, but no remains of
a ladder were found in the room.</p>
<p>Kiva B is the largest ceremonial chamber in Square Tower House,
measuring 16 feet 9 inches in diameter over all. This kiva is not only
one of the best preserved, but also one of the most instructive in Square
Tower House, since half of the roof, with the original cribbing, is still in
place, extending completely around the periphery. It has six pilasters
and as many banquettes. Where the plaster had not fallen, it was found
to have several layers.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</div>
<p class="center">PETROGLYPHS AND PICTOGRAPHS</p>
<p>The perpendicular cliff back of Square Tower House has several different
forms of incised petroglyphs. From the fact that these usually occur on
the cliff above the kiva roofs, they may be regarded as connected in some
way with a religious symbolism. A few pictographs are also found on
stones set in the walls of the rooms.</p>
<h3 id="c6">OAK TREE HOUSE</h3>
<p>The ruin formerly called Willow House, but now known as Oak Tree
House, lies on the north side of Fewkes Canyon, in a symmetrical cave and
has an upper and a lower part. The two noteworthy features of Oak Tree
House are the kivas and the remnant of the wall of a circular room made
of sticks plastered with adobe but destitute of stone masonry.</p>
<p>Oak Tree House has seven kivas and may be called a large cliff dwelling.
One of the kivas has a semicircular ground plan with a rectangular room
on the straight side. There are no pilasters or banquettes in this kiva. The
floor of another kiva was almost wholly occupied by a series of grinding
bins, indicating a secondary use. The repair work on Oak Tree House has
not yet been completed, but a small collection of specimens at one end of
the ruin shows the nature of the objects thus far found.</p>
<h3 id="c7">SUN SET HOUSE</h3>
<p>Looking across Cliff Canyon from Sun Point one can see the fine ruin
called Sun Set House, formerly known as Community House. This ruin,
like many other cliff dwellings, has an upper and a lower house, the former
being relatively larger than is usually the case. Although Sun Set House is
accessible, it has never been excavated.</p>
<h3 id="c8">SUN TEMPLE</h3>
<p>The cliff houses considered in the preceding pages are habitations.
There are also specialized buildings on the Mesa Verde which were never
inhabited but were used for other purposes. Two of these are supposed to
have been devoted to religious purposes and are known as Sun Temple
and Fire Temple.</p>
<p>Sun Temple is situated west of Cliff Palace, across Cliff Canyon on a
high cliff at the entrance to Fewkes Canyon. Up to the year 1915 the
site of Sun Temple was a mound of earth and stones, all showing artificial
working or the pecking of primitive stone hammers. This mound had a
circular depression in the middle and its surface was covered with trees
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
and bushes. No high walls projected above the ground nor was there any
intimation of the size or character of the buried building. It was believed
to be a pueblo or communal habitation. Excavation of this mound brought
into view one of the most instructive buildings in the park.</p>
<p>Sun Temple is a type of ruin hitherto unknown in the park. The building
excavated shows the best masonry and is the most mysterious form yet
discovered in a region rich in so many prehistoric remains. Although at
first there was some doubt as to the use of this building, it was early recognized
that it was not constructed for habitation, and it is now believed
that it was intended for the performance of rites and ceremonies; the first
of its type devoted to religious purposes yet recognized in the Southwest.</p>
<p>The ruin was purposely constructed in a commanding situation in the
neighborhood of large inhabited cliff houses. It sets somewhat back from
the edge of the canyon, but near enough to present a marked object from
all sides, especially the neighboring mesas. It must have presented an imposing
appearance rising on top of a point high above inaccessible, perpendicular
cliffs. No better place could have been chosen for a religious
building in which the inhabitants of many cliff dwellings could gather and
together perform their great ceremonial dramas.</p>
<p>The ground plan of the ruin has the form of the letter D. The building
is in two sections, the larger of which, taken separately, is also D-shaped.
This is considered the original building. The addition enlarging it is regarded
as an annex. The south wall, which is straight and includes both
the original building and the annex, is 131.7 feet long. The ruin is 64 feet
wide.</p>
<p>There are about 1,000 feet of walls in the whole building. These walls
average 4 feet in thickness, and are double, enclosing a central core of
rubble and adobe. They are uniformly well made.</p>
<p>The fine masonry, the decorated stones that occur in it, and the unity of
plan stamp Sun Temple as the highest example of Mesa Verde architecture.</p>
<p>The walls were constructed of the sandstone of the neighborhood. Many
stone hammers and pecking stones were found in the vicinity.</p>
<p class="center">THE SUN SYMBOL</p>
<p>On the upper surface of a large rock protruding from the base of the
southwest corner of the building a peculiar depression, surrounded by
radiating ridges, was found. To primitive minds, this may have appeared
as a symbol of the sun and, therefore, deemed an object of great significance,
to be protected as a shrine. This natural impression may have prompted
Dr. Fewkes in the naming of this ruin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</div>
<p class="center">ARCHITECTURAL FEATURES</p>
<p>There are three circular rooms in Sun Temple which from their form
may be identified as ceremonial in function, technically called kivas. Two
of these, free from other rooms, lie in the plaza that occupies the central
part of the main building, and one is embedded in rooms of the so-called
&ldquo;annex.&rdquo; Adjoining the last mentioned, also surrounded by rooms, is a
fourth circular chamber which is not a kiva. This room was found to be
almost completely filled with spalls or broken stones. Possibly this was
the place where the stones were hewn into shape before they were laid in
the walls.</p>
<p>The kiva that is situated in the west section of Sun Temple has a flue
attached to the south side, recalling the typical ventilator of a Mesa Verde
cliff kiva, and there are indications of the same structure in the two circular
chambers in the court. These kivas, however, have no banquettes
or pilasters to support a vaulted roof, and no fragments of roof beams were
found in the excavations made at Sun Temple. East of Sun Temple, where
formerly there was only a mound of stone and earth, there were found the
remains of a circular tower.</p>
<p>Most of the peripheral rooms of Sun Temple open into adjoining rooms,
a few into the central court, but none has external openings. Some of the
rooms are without lateral entrances, as if it were intended to enter them
through a hatch in the roof.</p>
<p>Not only pits indicative of the stone tools by which the stones forming the
masonry of Sun Temple were dressed appear on all the rocks used in its
construction, but likewise many bear incised symbols. Several of these
still remain in the walls of the building; others have been set in cement
near the outer wall of the eastern kiva. It is interesting to record that
some of the stones of which the walls were constructed were probably
quarried on the mesa top not far from the building, but as the surface of the
plateau is now forested, the quarries themselves are hidden in accumulated
soil and are difficult to discover.</p>
<p class="center">AGE</p>
<p>Sun Temple is believed to be among the latest constructed of all the aboriginal
buildings in the park, probably contemporary with Balcony House,
Spruce Tree House, and Cliff Palace.</p>
<p>Because of the absence of timbers or roof beams it is impossible to tell
when Sun Temple was begun or how long it took for its construction or
when it was deserted. There are indications that its walls may never have
been completed, and from the amount of fallen stones there can hardly be
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
a doubt that when it was abandoned they had been carried up in some
places at least 6 feet above their present level. The top of the wall had been
worn down at any rate 6 feet in the interval between the time it was abandoned
and the date of excavation of the mound. No one can tell the length
of this interval in years.</p>
<p>We have, however, knowledge of the lapse of time, because the mound
had accumulated enough soil on its surface to support growth of large trees.
Near the summit of the highest wall in the annex there grew a juniper
tree of great antiquity, alive and vigorous when excavation work was
begun. This tree undoubtedly sprouted after the desertion of the building
and grew after a mound had developed from fallen walls. Its roots penetrated
into the adjacent rooms and derived nourishment from the soil filling
them.</p>
<p>Necessarily, when these roots were cut off the tree was killed. It was then
cut off about a foot above the ground, but the stump remains. A section of
this tree at that point was found by Gordon Parker, supervisor of Montezuma
National Forest, to have 360 annual rings; its heart is decayed, but
its size suggests other rings, and that a few more years can be added to its
age. It is not improbable that this tree began to grow on the top of the Sun
Temple mound shortly after the year 1540, when Coronado first entered
New Mexico, but how great an interval elapsed during which the walls fell
to form the mound in which it grew, and how much earlier the foundations
of the ruined walls were laid, no one can tell. A conservative guess of 350
years is allowable for the interval between construction and the time the
cedar began to sprout, thus carrying the antiquity of Sun Temple back to
about 1200 A. D.</p>
<p class="center">UNITY OF CONSTRUCTION</p>
<p>The argument that appeals most strongly to many in supporting the
theory that Sun Temple was a ceremonial building is the unity shown in
its construction. A preconceived plan existed in the minds of the builders
before they began work on the main building. Sun Temple was not constructed
haphazardly, nor was its form due to addition of one clan after
another, each adding rooms to a preexisting nucleus. There is no indication
of patching one building to another, so evident at Cliff Palace and other
large cliff dwellings. The construction of the recess in the south wall, situated
exactly, to an inch, midway in its length, shows it was planned from
the beginning.</p>
<p>We can hardly believe that one clan could have been numerous enough
to construct a house so large and massive. Its walls are too extensive; the
work of dressing the stones too great. Those who made it must have belonged
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
to several clans fused together, and if they united for this common
work they were in a higher state of sociological development than a loosely
connected population of a cliff dwelling.</p>
<p class="center">BUILDERS</p>
<p>On the theory that this building was erected by people from several neighboring
cliff dwellings for ceremonies held in common, we may suppose that
the builders came daily from their dwellings in Cliff Palace and other houses
and returned at night, after they had finished work, to their homes. The
trails down the sides of the cliffs which the workmen used are still to be seen.
The place was frequented by many people, but there is no evidence that
any one clan dwelt near this mysterious building during its construction.</p>
<p>The argument that cliff dwellers in the neighborhood built Sun Temple
and that incoming aliens had nothing to do with its construction seems very
strong. The architectural differences between it and Cliff Palace are not
objections, for the architectural form of Sun Temple may be regarded as a
repetition, in the open, of a form of building that developed in a cliff house;
the rounded north wall conforms with the rear of a cave and the straight
south wall reproduces the front of a cliff dwelling. The recess midway in the
south wall of Sun Temple could be likened without forcing the comparison
to a similar recess which occurs at the main entrance into Cliff Palace.</p>
<p>Sun Temple was not built by an alien people, but by the cliff dwellers as
a specialized building mainly for religious purposes, and, so far as known, is
the first of its type recognized in the Mesa Verde area.</p>
<h3 id="c9">NEW FIRE-HOUSE GROUP</h3>
<p class="center">FIRE TEMPLE</p>
<p>Fire Temple is one of the most remarkable cliff houses in the park, if
not in the whole Southwest. It is situated in a shallow cave in the north
wall of Fewkes Canyon, near the head of the same, and can readily be seen
from the road along the southwest rim of the canyon. This ruin was formerly
called Painted House, but when it was excavated in May 1920
evidence was obtained that it was a specialized building and not a habitation.
The facts brought to light point to the theory that it was consecrated
to the fire cult, one of the most ancient forms of worship.</p>
<p>The ruin is rectangular in form, almost completely filling the whole of
its shallow cave, and the walls of the rooms extend to the roof. A ground
plan shows a central court 50 feet long and about 25 feet broad, flanked
at each end with massive-walled buildings two stories high. The walls of
these rooms are well constructed, plastered red and white within and on
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
the side turned to the court. The white plaster is adorned with symbolic
figures. The beams used in the construction of the ceiling of the lower
room are missing, but the walls show clearly that the structure was formerly
two stories high. No beams were used in the construction of the floors, the
lower story having been filled in with fragments of rocks on which was
plastered a good adobe floor.</p>
<p>The court or plaza was bounded by a low wall on the south side, the
buildings enclosing the east and west ends, where there was a banquette,
apparently for spectators. The north side of the court was formed by the
solid rocks of the cliff, but on the lower part a narrow masonry wall had
been laid up about head high, projecting from the cliff a foot and less on
the top. The wall was formerly plastered red below and white above,
triangular figures and zigzag markings recalling symbols of lightning on
the line of the junction of the red and white surfaces.</p>
<p>About the center of the court on a well-hardened adobe floor there is a
circular walled fire pit containing an abundance of ashes, and on either side
of it are foundations of small rectangular structures.</p>
<p>In the central fire pit fire was kept burning during the elaborate fire
dances of the natives, and possibly also a perpetual fire was conserved in
this pit from one act of kindling the new fire to another. The function of
the rectangular enclosures lying one on each side of the circular enclosures
is unknown. The new fire may have been kindled in the middle of the three
rooms of the lowest tier west of the main court. This is a painted room, and
on its walls there still remain in fair preservation a row of five symbols of
fire, numerous pictures of mountain sheep and other animals.</p>
<p>Just west of Fire Temple there is a group of rooms which were evidently
habitations, since household utensils were found in them. One of these
rooms has in the floor a vertical shaft which opens outside the house walls
like a ventilator. The former use of this structure is unknown. Although
the Fire Temple was not inhabited, there were undoubtedly dwellings
nearby.</p>
<p class="center">NEW FIRE HOUSE</p>
<p>A hundred feet east of the Fire Temple there are two low caves, one
above the other, in which may have lived those who attended this sanctuary.
The ruin is the New Fire House proper, or the habitation of the fire priests
and their families. The rooms in the lower cave were fitted for habitation,
consisting of two, possibly three, circular ceremonial rooms and a few secular
rooms; but the upper cave is destitute of the former. The large rooms of
the upper house look like granaries for the storage of provisions, although
possibly they also were inhabited. In the rear of the large rooms identified
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
as granaries was found a small room with a well-preserved human skeleton
accompanied with mortuary pottery. One of these mortuary offerings is a
fine mug made of black and white ware beautifully decorated; a specimen
worthy of exhibition with the best in any museum. In the rear of the cave
were three well-constructed grinding bins, their metates still in place.</p>
<p>The upper house is now approached from the lower by foot holes in the
cliff and a ladder. Evidences of a secondary occupation of one of the kivas
in the lower house appear in a wall of crude masonry without mortar, part
of a rectangular room built diagonally across the kiva. The plastering on
the rear walls of the lower house is particularly well preserved. One of
the kivas has, in place of a deflector and ventilator shaft, a small rectangular
walled enclosure surrounded by a wall, recalling structures on the floor of
the kivas of Sun Temple. The meaning of this departure from the prescribed
form of ventilator is not apparent.</p>
<h3 id="c10">CEDAR TREE TOWER</h3>
<p>Hidden in the timber about one-half mile east of the main entrance highway,
and a mile north of Spruce Tree Camp, are a tower and kiva of especial
interest. The associating of the two, without dwellings accompanying
them, is unique and leads to many conjectures as to their use and purpose.</p>
<p>The masonry is excellent and the massive character of the walls and the
beautiful workmanship indicate some important use, for a large amount
of labor was expended in the construction of the buildings of this group.
Some of the stones are so large that it is difficult for one man to handle them.
The components are beautifully dressed, especially those which form the
rounded corners of the tower on the inner and outer boundaries. The
walls of the tower are uniformly 2 feet in width, and at the highest point
they still stand to the height of 15 feet.</p>
<h3 id="c11">FAR VIEW HOUSE, A MESA VERDE PUEBLO</h3>
<p>Archeological investigations have shown that the later cultures of the
Mesa Verde built compact pueblo-style structures on the open mesa land
separating the deep canyons. Lacking natural protection of the caves and
cliffs of the canyons, a closely knit and compact structure was necessary for
defensive purposes. Not having to conform to the irregular contours of the
cave as in the cliff-house type, the structure assumed a roughly rectangular
shape in the open, with the kivas within, protected by the adjacent outside
living and storage rooms. The roofed-over kivas formed small open courts
within the higher outside walls. Structurally, there is but little difference
between the cliff house and the pueblo; undoubtedly they are homogeneous.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</div>
<div class="img" id="fig5">
<img src="images/p022.jpg" alt="A Mesa Verde surface ruin. Far View House." width="500" height="337" />
<p class="center"><i><span class="small">A Mesa Verde surface ruin. Far View House.</span></i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</div>
<p>Four and a half miles north of Spruce Tree Camp the park road passes
through 16 major and many minor mounds. This is the so-called Mummy
Lake group, a misnomer, since the walled depression at the crest of the
slope above the group was never used as a reservoir, although in the
spring of the year water is still conducted thereto by the drainage ditches
constructed by the early cowmen in the park in their efforts to impound
sufficient water for their stock. And, again, mummies are never found
where the least dampness occurs.</p>
<p>The first unit of this group to be excavated was named Far View House
because of the wonderful panorama of diversified terrain that is visible in
Colorado, New Mexico, and Arizona from the walls of the ruin. At the
beginning of the work, this mound appeared very much as any of the
other adjacent major mounds, no sign of standing wall appearing above
the even contour of the ruin. Heavy growths of sagebrush covered the
whole area. Three months&rsquo; time was devoted to the excavation in revealing
the rectangular pueblo, 100 by 113 feet in size, now seen. The slow
crumbling of the heavy dirt-covered roofs and the walls, together with
the annual deposit of wind-blown sand from the San Juan country early
each spring, gradually filled the rooms to the level of the standing walls,
after which destructive elements and forces can little change the contour
of any ruin.</p>
<p>The external features of Far View House are apparent as we approach
its walls; mounting to the top of the highest wall we can best observe the
general plan. This pueblo is rectangular in shape, consisting of concentrated
rooms with a court surrounded by a wall annexed to the south side.
On its southeast corner, a little less than 100 feet away, lies the cemetery
from which have been taken a number of skeletons with their offerings of
food bowls and other objects, such as was the custom of these people to
deposit in the graves of their dead.</p>
<p>At its highest point on the north wall the pueblo had three stories, but
on the southern side there was but a single story. This building was terraced,
one tier of rooms above another. In the corner of the interior of
the highest room may still be seen the ancient fireplaces and stones for
grinding corn, set in their original positions as used by the former inhabitants.
There are no external windows or passages, except on the south
side where midway in length is a recess in which was placed a ladder in
order to be hidden from view. The inhabitants evidently used the roof
of the lowest terrace for many occupations. A birdseye view shows that
all the rooms, now roofless, fall into two groups.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</div>
<p>In the center of this mass of rooms is a kiva 32 feet in diameter, and
around it are three smaller kivas. The size of the large kiva is noteworthy.
In the cliff dwellings the kivas were necessarily small because
of the limited floor space, but in the surface villages, where unlimited
space was available, they were often large. This arrangement of one
large kiva and several small ones is common. It might indicate that
each clan had a small kiva of its own but that in the major ceremonies,
when all of the clans worked together, the large ceremonial room was
used. The structural details of the large kiva are identical with those of
the smaller ones. The only variation is in the size.</p>
<p>The rooms surrounding these circular ones vary somewhat in form but
are, as a rule, rectangular, the shapes of those near the kivas being triangular
to fill the necessary spaces. The contents of the rectangular
rooms show that they were inhabited. Artifacts were found and indications
of various industries as well as marks of smoke from their fireplaces
appear on the walls. From the nature of this evidence there is no doubt
that Far View House was once inhabited by the people living the same
way as those dwelling in Spruce Tree House.</p>
<p>The court added to the pueblo on its south side is enclosed by a low wall.
Here were probably performed, in ancient times, the many religious
dances and festivals.</p>
<p>Far View House is but one of the 16 pueblos in the Mummy Lake
group, and at the period of maximum development could have housed a
large population. To the north and east, where the two branches of Soda
Canyon join, another large village or group has been located, and one can
almost trace the trail across the west fork of Soda Canyon to the neighboring
village and imagine the dusky visitors going from one to the other in
prehistoric times. Each narrow tonguelike mesa of the Mesa Verde has
its ruins of either isolated pueblo structures, or adjacent groups, denoting
the widespread distribution of the mesa pueblo builders.</p>
<p>Pottery is the best index as to the chronological sequence of the ruins
in the Southwest, and in examining the pottery of some of the mesa-type
pueblos it is found that some contain pottery antedating that of the cliff-house
culture, while others contain similar types. Undoubtedly, they
were simultaneously inhabited, in part at least, and the transitory period
was of long duration; but the period in prehistoric time when they were
built and later deserted has not been determined. We cannot say from
data now at hand when this took place, documentary history affording
no help.</p>
<p>The aborigines who lived near these ruins when discovered in 1874 belong
to the Utes, a Shoshonean stock who disclaimed all knowledge of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
people who constructed these buildings. They avoided them as uncanny
and even now can only with difficulty be induced to enter them. They
have dim legends of conflicts between the earliest Utes and cliff dwellers.
Unfortunately, however, such legendary evidence is not reliable, as the
general mythology of these people has been much distorted due to foreign
contacts.</p>
<p class="center">OTHER RUINS NEAR FAR VIEW HOUSE</p>
<p>During the season of 1922 excavation and repair work in the vicinity
of Far View House was carried on simultaneously. Among the ruins
excavated were Pipe Shrine House, One Clan House, Far View Tower,
and Megalithic House.</p>
<h3 id="c12">EARTH LODGE A</h3>
<p>In 1922 one of the Late Basket Maker pit houses was excavated on the
mesa above Square Tower House. This structure is known as Earth
Lodge A. Although it once had a mud and pole roof almost as high as a
man&rsquo;s head, nothing now remains but the underground part of the house.
None of these pit houses have ever been found that have not been burned,
and only a few pieces of charcoal remain as evidence of the former roof.
The pit is 30 inches deep and 18 feet in diameter. In the center is a fire
pit. In the floor are also four holes, forming a large square, in which the
roof supports once stood. The walls of the pit were formerly plastered
with a thick layer of mud, but only a few patches of this remain. Around
the edge of the room, where the floor was low, were a number of small storage
bins made of thin stone slabs. No side entrance was located during
excavation. In some of the pit houses evidence has shown that entrance
was often made by means of a ladder through the smokehole in the roof.</p>
<p>This was a typical home of the Late Basket Makers who were living in
this region when the Pueblo Indians arrived about 700 A. D. These pit
houses passed out of existence as soon as the masonry wall was perfected.</p>
<h3 id="c13">UNEXCAVATED RUINS</h3>
<p>Of all the ruins in Mesa Verde National Park only 28 have been named
and only 30 excavated. No survey of the unexcavated sites has been
made, and the total number of ruins is unknown. Several hundred cliff
dwellings have been discovered, and new ones will probably be found in
the more remote canyons. The surface pueblos outnumber the cliff dwellings,
and a careful search would reveal many that are now hidden by a
thick growth of underbrush. The earth lodges of the Late Basket Makers
are so common that hundreds will be brought to light by careful search.
Dozens of them can be located in a half-hour walk over any of the mesas.</p>

<h2 id="c14"><br /><span class="small">DATES FOR MESA VERDE RUINS ESTABLISHED BY THE TREE-RING CHRONOLOGY<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a></span></h2>
<p>Dr. A. E. Douglass, director of Steward Observatory, University of Arizona,
established the tree-ring chronology for dating Southwestern ruins.
This chronology is based upon the facts that solar changes affect our weather
and weather in turn the trees of the arid Southwest, as elsewhere, and that
such affects are recorded in the variation of tree-ring growth during wet
and dry years. Thus the tree-ring record of living trees has been extended
into the past by arranging beams from historic pueblos in their proper sequence
so that the inner diaries of one dovetailed the outer entries of its
predecessor, and in turn overlapped the diary of the living trees. After
completing the series from living trees and pueblos, of known dates, the
record has been continued through the cross-sections of prehistoric beams
of fir and pine that were chopped with the stone axes. The continuation
of this chronology is only limited by the finding of earlier beams than those
used in the established chronology.</p>
<p>The National Geographic Society tree-ring expedition took, in all, 49
beam sections from ruins within Mesa Verde National Park. During 1932
and 1933 further tree-ring research was carried on in this area and additional
dates have been secured. Presuming that the year of cutting the timber
was the year of actual use in construction, the following dates have been
established for the major cliff dwellings:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Mug House, A. D. 1066</p>
<p class="t0">Cliff Palace, A. D. 1073-1273</p>
<p class="t0">Oak Tree House, A. D. 1112-84</p>
<p class="t0">Spring House, A. D. 1115</p>
<p class="t0">Hemenway House, A. D. 1171</p>
<p class="t0">Balcony House, A. D. 1190-1272</p>
<p class="t0">Long House, A. D. 1204-11</p>
<p class="t0">Square Tower House, A. D. 1204-46</p>
<p class="t0">Spruce Tree House, A. D. 1230-74</p>
<p class="t0">New Fire House, A. D. 1259</p>
<p class="t0">Ruin No. 16, A. D. 1261</p>
<p class="t0">Buzzard House, A. D. 1273</p>
</div>
<p>Since considerable tree-ring material from these ruins remains yet to be
examined, the dates given above are not final. On the basis of present evidence,
Cliff Palace, the largest and most complex cliff house within the park,
shows an occupancy of 200 years.</p>
<p>It is an interesting fact that all of the dates fall just short of the beginning
of the great drought, which the tree-ring chronology shows commenced in
1276 and extended to 1299, a period of 23 years.</p>

<h2 id="c15"><br /><span class="small">DISCOVERIES OF RECENT YEARS</span></h2>
<p>In 1923 Roy Henderson and A. B. Hardin discovered the largest and
finest watchtower that had yet been found. The tower was circular, 25
feet in height and 11 feet in diameter. Loopholes at various levels commanded
the approach from every exposed quarter.</p>
<p>During the winter of 1924 the north refuse space of Spruce Tree House
was excavated. Two child burials were found, one partially mummified,
the other skeletal only. With one was found a mug, a ladle, a digging
stick, and two ring baskets that had held food. Several corrugated jars
were found, together with miscellaneous material. A layer of turkey
droppings a foot thick indicated the space had been used as a turkey pen.</p>
<p>During January and February of 1926, when snow was available as a
water supply, excavations were carried on in Step House Cave, by Superintendent
Jesse L. Nusbaum. In 1891 Nordenski&ouml;ld had found many fine
burials in this cave and it had suffered greatly from pothunting. The
cliff dweller refuse at the south end of the cave had not been thoroughly
cleaned out, however, and it was under this layer of trash that the important
discovery was made. Three of the Lake Basket Maker pit houses
were found, giving the first evidence that these people had used the caves
before the cliff dwellers. Very few artifacts were found because of the
earlier pothunting. In 1926 also a low, deep cave opposite Fire Temple
was excavated, and a small amount of Basket Maker material found. Most
interesting were two tapered cylinders of crystallized salt that still bore the
imprint of the molder&rsquo;s hands. While bracing a slipping boulder in Cliff
Palace, Fred Jeeps found, in 1916, a sandal of the Early Basket Maker
type that indicates a former occupancy of the cave by the first group of
Agricultural Indians in this region.</p>
<p>In 1927 Bone Awl House was excavated. A series of unusually fine bone
awls was found that suggested the name for the ruin. Much miscellaneous
material was also found. Another small cliff dwelling nearby was cleaned
out. One baby mummy and an adult burial were found, as well as some
pottery and bone and stone tools. This ruin is reached by a spectacular
series of 104 footholds that the cliff dwellers had cut in the almost perpendicular
canyon wall.</p>
<p>During March of 1928 and the winter of 1929 restricted excavations were
conducted in ruins 11 to 19, inclusive, on the west side of Wetherill Mesa.
Several burials were found, all in poor condition because of dampness. Outstanding
was an unusual bird pendant of hematite with crystal eyes set into
drilled sockets with pi&ntilde;on gum. Forty-two bowls were reconstructed from
the sherds found.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</div>
<p>In the summer of 1929 Mr. and Mrs. Harold S. Gladwin and associates
of Gila Pueblo, Globe, Ariz., assisted by Deric Nusbaum, conducted an
archeological survey of small-house ruins on Chapin Mesa and in the
canyon heads along the North Rim. The survey covered 250 sites. One
hundred sherds were collected from each site and studied to identify the
pottery types, the sequence of their development, and their relationship to
pottery types of other southwestern archeological areas.</p>
<p>The forest fire of 1934 revealed many hitherto unknown ruins. Two
splendid watchtowers were found on the west cliff of Rock Canyon. In a
small area at the head of Long Canyon 10 new Early Pueblo ruins were
located and no doubt scores of others will be found upon more careful
search. In the heads of the small canyons many dams and terraces were
noted.</p>
<p>In the stabilization program that was carried on in 1934-35 a number of
artifacts were found. A certain amount of debris had to be moved in
order that the weakened walls and slipping foundations might be strengthened
and varied finds resulted. Axes, bone awls, sandals, pottery, planting
sticks, and similar articles were most common, but a few burials were also
found.</p>
<p>In August 1934 the undisturbed skeleton of an old woman was found on
the bare floor of a small ruin just across the canyon from the public camp
grounds. This skeleton, of particular importance because of fusion of the
spinal column, had apparently remained exposed and undisturbed through
more than seven centuries.</p>
<p>Because of the fact that no detailed, comprehensive survey has ever been
made of the archeological resources of the park, the findings of new ruins,
artifacts, and human remains are more or less regularly reported at the
park museum.</p>
<h2 id="c16"><br /><span class="small">PREHISTORIC INHABITANTS OF THE MESA VERDE</span></h2>
<p>The so-called &ldquo;Mesa Verde cliff dwellers&rdquo; were not the first of the prehistoric
southwestern cultures, nor were they the first human occupants of
the natural caves that abound in the area of the park. Centuries before
the cliff-dweller culture with its complex social organizations, agriculture,
and highly developed arts of masonry, textiles, and ceramics, it is thought
that small groups of primitive Mongoloid hunters crossed from the northeastern
peninsula of Asia to the western coast of Alaska. The Bering Strait,
with but 60 miles of water travel, offered the safest and easiest route.</p>
<p>Just when these migrations to the east had their origin and how long
they continued cannot definitely be said, but it is thought the earliest
Mongoloid hunters were in northwestern America about twelve to fifteen
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
thousand years ago. When Columbus &ldquo;discovered&rdquo; America the continent
was inhabited from Alaska to the Strait of Magellan and from the
Pacific to the Atlantic coasts.</p>
<p>For perhaps several thousand years following the first migrations little
of great significance developed. There undoubtedly was cultural progress,
but it was slow, and in the long perspective of time its evidences are hardly
discernible. With the knowledge and benefits of agriculture, which was
probably developed first in Mexico, hunting gave way to husbandry,
nomadism to sedentary life, and there followed a great period of change and
advancement. The introduction of corn or Indian maize into what is now
the southwestern United States may be called the antecedent condition for
all advanced cultures of the area.</p>
<p>Evidence has not yet been established that the first of the maize-growing
Indians of the Southwest were permanent occupants of the Mesa Verde.
Nevertheless, in the Cliff Palace cave, well below the horizon or floor level
of the cliff dwellers, archeologists have found a yucca fiber sandal of a
distinctive type which is associated only with the first agricultural civilization.
From this evidence it would be reasonable to assume that the caves
of Mesa Verde at least offered temporary shelter, if not permanent homes,
to the people of this period.</p>
<p>The earliest culture so far definitely identified as having permanent habitation
on the Mesa Verde is the Basket Maker III or the Second Agricultural
Basket Maker first found in Step House cave on the west side of the
park below the debris of the latter cliff-house occupation. Recent excavations
and archeological surveys furnish conclusive evidence that the second
agricultural people were most numerous in the area now included in this
national park, and they constructed their roughly circular subterranean
rooms not only in the sandy floor of the caves but also in the red soil on the
comparatively level mesas separating the numerous canyons. Late Basket
Maker House A, formerly known as Earth Lodge A, is an excellent example
of this early type of structure. Up to this time excavations have failed to
uncover a single house structure of this type not destroyed by fire.</p>
<p>These early inhabitants made basketry, excelled in the art of weaving,
and it is believed were the first of the southwestern cultures to invent fired
pottery. The course of this invention can be traced from the crude sun-dried
vessel tempered with shredded cedar bark to the properly tempered
and durable fired vessel.</p>
<p>Then followed a long development in house structure, differing materially
from this earlier type. Horizontal masonry replaced the cruder
attempts of house-wall construction; rectangular or squarish forms replaced
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
the somewhat circular and earlier type; and gradually the single-room
structure was grouped in ever-enlarging units which assumed varying forms
of arrangement as the development progressed. The art of pottery making
improved concurrently with the more complex house structure. This later
period represents the intermediate era of development from the crude Late
Basket Maker dwellings to the remarkable structures of the &ldquo;Cliff House
Culture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During this period of transition new people penetrated the area. The
Basket Makers throughout the course of their development were consistently
a long-headed group. The appearance of an alien group is recorded
through the finding of skeletons with broad or round skulls and a deformed
occiput. These new people, the Pueblos, took over, changed, and adapted
to their own needs the material culture of the earlier inhabitants.</p>
<p>The cliff dwellers were not content with the crude buildings and earth
lodges that satisfied as homes during earlier periods of occupancy. For
their habitations they shaped stones into regular forms, sometimes ornamenting
them with designs, and laid them in mud mortar, one on another.
Their masonry has resisted the destructive forces of the elements for
centuries.</p>
<p>The arrangement of houses in a cliff dwelling the size of Cliff Palace is
characteristic and is intimately associated with the distribution of the
social divisions of its former inhabitants.</p>
<p>The population was composed of a number of units, possibly clans, each
of which had its more or less distinct social organization, as indicated in the
arrangement of the rooms. The rooms occupied by a clan were not necessarily
connected, although generally neighboring rooms were distinguished
from one another by their uses. Thus, each clan had its men&rsquo;s room, which
is ceremonially called the &ldquo;kiva.&rdquo; Each clan had also one or more rooms,
which may be styled the living rooms, and other enclosures for granaries.
The corn was ground into meal in another room containing the metate set
in a stone bin or trough. Sometimes the rooms had fireplaces, although
these were generally in the plazas or on the housetops. All these different
rooms, taken together, constituted the houses that belonged to one clan.</p>
<p>The conviction that each kiva denotes a distinct social unit, as a clan or a
family, is supported by a general similarity in the masonry of the kiva walls
and that of adjacent houses ascribed to the same clan. From the number of
these rooms it would appear that there were at least 23 social units or clans
in Cliff Palace.</p>
<p>Apparently there is no uniformity or prearranged plan in the distribution
of the kivas. As religious belief and custom prescribed that these rooms
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
should be subterranean, the greatest number were placed in front of the
rectangular buildings where it was easiest to construct them. When necessary,
because of limited space or other conditions, kivas were also built far
back in the cave and inclosed by a double wall of masonry, with the walls
being spaced about two and a half to three feet apart. The section between
the walls was then backfilled with earth or rubble to the level of the kiva
roof. In that way the ceremonial structure was artificially made subterranean,
as their beliefs required.</p>
<p>In addition to their ability as architects and masons, the cliff dwellers
excelled in the art of pottery making and as agriculturists. Their decorated
pottery&mdash;a black design on pearly white background&mdash;will compare favorably
with pottery of the other cultures of the prehistoric Southwest.</p>
<p>As their sense of beauty was keen, their art, though primitive, was true;
rarely realistic, generally symbolic. Their decoration of cotton fabrics and
ceramic work might be called beautiful, even when judged by our own
standards. They fashioned axes, spear points, and rude tools of stone; they
wove sandals, and made attractive basketry.</p>
<p>The staple product of the cliff dwellers was corn; they also planted beans
and gourds. This limited selection was perhaps augmented by pi&ntilde;on nuts
and yucca fruit&mdash;indigenous products found in abundance. Nevertheless,
successful agriculture on the semiarid plateau of the Mesa Verde must have
been dependent upon hard work and diligent efforts. Without running
streams irrigation was impossible and success depended upon the ability
of the farmer to save the crop through the dry period of June and early
July.</p>
<p>Rain at the right time was the all-important problem, and so confidently
did they believe that they were dependent upon the gods to make the rain
fall and the corn grow that they worshiped the sun as the father of all life
and the earth as the mother who brought them all their material blessings.</p>
<p>From Dr. A. E. Douglass&rsquo;s tree-ring chronology the earliest date so far
established for the Mesa Verde cliff dwellings is 1066 A. D. and the latest
date 1274 A. D. While it should not be imagined that these are the all-inclusive
dates representing the total time of the cliff-dweller culture, it is
interesting to note that this same tree-ring story tells us that a great drought
commenced in 1276 and extended for a 23-year period to 1299. It may
logically be presumed that the prehistoric population was gradually forced
to withdraw from the area as the drought continued and to establish itself
near more favorable sources of water supply.</p>
<p>The so-called &ldquo;Aztec ruin&rdquo;, which is situated on the banks of the Animas
River in northwestern New Mexico, substantiates this hypothesis of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
voluntary desertion of the cliff dwellings. In this ruin is found unmistakable
evidence of a secondary occupation which has been definitely identified
as a Mesa Verde settlement.</p>
<p>It is thought that certain of the present-day Pueblo Indians are descendants,
in part at least, of the cliff dwellers. Many of these Indian towns or
pueblos still survive in the States of New Mexico and Arizona, the least
modified of which are the villages of the Hopi, situated not far from the
Grand Canyon National Park.</p>
<h2 id="c17"><br /><span class="small">FAUNA AND FLORA</span></h2>
<p>The fauna and flora of Mesa Verde should be particularly interesting
to visitors. A combination of desert types from the lower arid country
and mountain types, usually associated with regions of higher rainfall,
occur here. The desert types are highly specialized to cope with their
environment, particularly the plant and smaller animal life.</p>
<p>Rocky Mountain mule deer are perhaps the only big game to be found
abundantly in the park. They are often seen. Their numbers in the
park, however, vary greatly according to the season. It is hoped to reintroduce
the native species of Rocky Mountain bighorn, as soon as range
sufficient for the needs of this species has been added to the park.</p>
<p>Cougars, or mountain lions, are part of the wildlife of the park and,
strange to say, are occasionally seen in broad daylight. In other national
parks these animals are rarely seen even by rangers.</p>
<p>Coyotes and foxes are not as numerous as they once were on the mesa.
As a result, many of the smaller animals such as porcupines and prairie
dogs have greatly increased. Wildcats are fairly common but are only
occasionally seen.</p>
<p>Game birds are represented by the dusky grouse and scaled quail, both
desert types. No wild turkeys are found in the park now, although it is
believed that they were once there. Fragments of bones discovered in
the ruins indicate that the cliff dwellers kept turkeys. Whether these
were wild turkeys from the mesa or birds brought in from elsewhere is a
question that has not as yet been answered. At present the reintroduction
of wild turkeys to Mesa Verde is under consideration.</p>
<p>Among the most interesting animal residents of Mesa Verde are the
lizards. Some of these are: the horned lizard, the western spotted or
earless lizard, the collared lizard, the striped race-runner, utas, rock
swifts, and sagebrush swifts.</p>
<p>Although Mesa Verde receives considerably more rainfall than true
desert areas, vegetation is fairly sparse at the best and is generally of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
arid type. Cacti of a number of varieties flourish but are conspicuous
only in May and June when they bloom. Pi&ntilde;on pine, juniper, Douglas
fir, and western yellow pine represent most of the large evergreens. Oregon
grape, yucca, and mistletoe (on the junipers) are some of the other plants
found over the area. Nearer the springs and water courses vegetation
is much more luxurious, but unfortunately these spots are far below the
level of the mesa and are mostly on privately owned land.</p>

<h2 id="c18"><br /><span class="small">HOW TO REACH THE PARK</span></h2>
<h3 id="c19">BY AUTOMOBILE</h3>
<p>Mesa Verde National Park may be reached by automobile from Denver,
Colorado Springs, Pueblo, and other Colorado points. Through Pueblo
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
one road leads to the park by way of Ca&ntilde;on City, from where one may look
down into the Royal Gorge, the deepest canyon in the world penetrated
by a railroad and river. This road passes through Salida and on through
Gunnison and Montrose, and then south through Ouray, Silverton, and
Durango. This route passes through some of Colorado&rsquo;s most magnificent
mountain scenery. Another road leads south from Pueblo through Walsenburg,
across La Veta Pass, on through Alamosa, Del Norte, Pagosa Springs,
and Durango, crossing Wolf Creek Pass en route. Both roads lead west
from Durango to Mancos and on into the park.</p>
<p>Motorists coming from Utah turn southward from Green River or
Thompsons, crossing the Colorado River at Moab, proceeding southward
to Monticello, thence eastward to Cortez, Colo., and the park.</p>
<p>From Arizona and New Mexico points, Gallup, on the National Old
Trails Road, is easily reached. The auto road leads north from Gallup
through the Navajo Indian Reservation and a corner of the Ute Indian
Reservation. At Shiprock Indian Agency, 98 miles north of Gallup, the
San Juan River is crossed.</p>
<h3 id="c20">BY RAILROAD</h3>
<p>Mesa Verde National Park is approached by rail both from the north
and from the south: From the north via the Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western
Railroad main transcontinental line through Grand Junction, and branch
lines through Montrose and Durango; from the south via the main transcontinental
line of the Santa Fe Railroad through Gallup, N. Mex.</p>
<p>The lines of the Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western System traverse some of
the most magnificent scenery of the Rocky Mountain region, a fact which
gives the journey to Mesa Verde zestful travel flavor. Two main-line routes
are provided to the Grand Junction gateway.</p>
<p>The Royal Gorge Route goes through the Grand Canyon of the Arkansas,
now spanned by an all-steel suspension bridge, 1,053 feet above the tracks
in the Royal Gorge. This route crosses Tennessee Pass (altitude, 10,240
feet) and follows the Eagle River to its junction with the Colorado River
at Dotsero, thence to Grand Junction.</p>
<p>Service was inaugurated in June 1934 via the new James Peak Route of
the D. &amp; R. G. W., utilizing the Moffat Tunnel (altitude at apex, 9,239
feet), 6.2-mile bore which pierces the Continental Divide, 50 miles west of
Denver. This route follows the Colorado River from Fraser, high on the
west slope of the continent, through Byers Canyon, Red Gorge, Gore
Canyon, and Red Canyon, thence over the Dotsero Cut-off to Dotsero,
where it joins the Royal Gorge Route. The new line saves 175 miles in
the distance from Denver to Grand Junction.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</div>
<h2 id="c21"><br /><span class="small">MOTOR TRANSPORTATION</span></h2>
<p>The Rio Grande Motor Way, Inc., of Grand Junction, Colo., from June
15 to September 15, operates a daily motor service from Grand Junction,
Delta, Montrose, Ouray, Silverton, Durango, and Mancos, Colo., to Spruce
Tree Lodge in Mesa Verde National Park. This motor bus leaves Grand
Junction at 7:15 a. m., via the scenic Chief Ouray Highway, stopping en
route at other places mentioned, crossing beautiful Red Mountain Pass
(altitude, 11,025 feet), arriving at Spruce Tree Lodge at 7 p. m. The stage
leaves the park at 7 a. m., arriving at Grand Junction at 5:40 p. m.</p>
<p>The round-trip fare between Grand Junction and the park is $26.56 if
four or more persons make the trip, and increases as the number of passengers
decreases.</p>
<p>Entrance to Mesa Verde from the south through Gallup, N. Mex., via
the Navajo and Southern Ute Indian Reservations, is growing constantly
in convenience and popularity. Hunter Clarkson, Inc., with headquarters
at El Navajo Hotel, in Gallup, operates two-day round trip light sedan
service, leaving Gallup at 8 a. m. on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays,
and returning to Gallup at 6 p. m. on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays.
This service permits the visiting of ruins in the park, in accordance with
regular schedules, on the afternoon of the first day and on the morning
of the second. The round trip fare per person (360 miles) is $25. A
minimum of two passengers is required. Fare for children, five and under
twelve, is $12.50. Meals and hotel accommodations en route or at the
park are not included. El Navajo Hotel, operated by Fred Harvey,
offers excellent overnight accommodations at Gallup.</p>
<p>The Cannon Ball Stage operates bus service from Gallup, via Shiprock
and Farmington, to Durango, where connection may be made with the
motor bus of the Rio Grande Motor Way, Inc., for the trip from Durango
to the park. The Cannon Ball Stage bus leaves Gallup each day at
11:30 a. m., arriving at Durango at 4:45 p. m. Returning it leaves
Durango at 8 a. m. and arrives at Gallup at 1 p. m. The fare from Gallup
to Durango is $6 one way and $10.80 for the round trip.</p>
<h2 id="c22"><br /><span class="small">ADMINISTRATION</span></h2>
<p>The Mesa Verde National Park is under the exclusive control of the
National Park Service of the Department of the Interior, which is authorized
to make rules and regulations and to establish such service as it may
deem necessary for the care and management of the park and the preservation
from injury or spoliation of the ruins and other remains of prehistoric
man within the limits of the reservation.</p>
<p>The National Park Service is represented in the actual administration of
the park by a superintendent, who is assisted in the protection and interpretation
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
of its natural and prehistoric features by a well-trained staff.
The present superintendent is Jesse L. Nusbaum, and his post-office address
is Mesa Verde National Park, Colo.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig7">
<img src="images/p036.jpg" alt="Headquarters Area." width="500" height="283" />
<p class="center"><i><span class="small">Headquarters Area.</span></i></p>
</div>
<p>The park season extends from May 15 to October 15, complete lodging
and food accommodations and automobile stage service being available
from June 15 to September 15. Informal lodging and meal accommodations
are provided during the remainder of the park season.</p>
<p>Exclusive jurisdiction over the park was ceded to the United States by
act of the Colorado Legislature approved May 2, 1927, and accepted by
Congress by act approved April 25, 1928. There is a United States
Commissioner at park headquarters.</p>
<p>Telegrams sent prepaid to Mancos, Colo., will be phoned to addressee
at park office. The post-office address for parties within the park is Mesa
Verde National Park, Colo.</p>
<h2 id="c23"><br /><span class="small">EDUCATIONAL SERVICE</span></h2>
<p>Educational service, carefully planned to provide each visitor with an
opportunity to interpret and appreciate the features of the Mesa Verde, is
provided, without charge, by the Government. This service is directed by
the park naturalist, who is assisted by a group of ranger naturalists.</p>
<h3 id="c24">GUIDED TRIPS TO THE RUINS</h3>
<p>During the season visitors are accompanied from the park museum to
the various ruins by competent ranger naturalists. These men, well
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
trained in the social and biological sciences, make it their duty to help the
visitor understand the natural and archeological features of the Mesa
Verde. Because of the need of protecting the ruins and the somewhat
devious trails by which they are reached, no one will be allowed to enter
any ruin except Spruce Tree House unless accompanied by a ranger
naturalist.</p>
<h3 id="c25">CAMP-FIRE TALKS</h3>
<p>Each evening at 8 o&rsquo;clock informal talks are given at the camp-fire circle
near park headquarters. The superintendent, the park naturalist, and
members of the educational staff give talks on the archeology of the region.
Visiting scientists, writers, lecturers, and noted travelers often contribute to
the evening&rsquo;s entertainment. After the talks six of the best singers and
dancers among the Navajo Indians employed in the park can usually be
persuaded, by modest voluntary contributions on the part of the visitors,
to give some of their songs and dances.</p>

</div>
<h3 id="c26">PARK MUSEUM</h3>
<p>The park museum houses very important and comprehensive collections
of excavated cliff-dweller and basket maker material, as well as restricted
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
collections of arts and crafts of modern Indians of the Southwest. These
collections have been assembled through the conduct of excavations within
the park and through loan or gift of materials by park friends or cooperating
institutions. This material is arranged in a definite chronological order.
By following through from the earliest culture to those of the present time
a clear and concise picture of the former material cultures of the Mesa Verde
and surrounding regions may be obtained.</p>
<p>One room has been set aside for natural history exhibits exemplifying
the geology, fauna, and flora of this peculiar mesa-canyon country.</p>
<h3 id="c27">REFERENCE LIBRARY</h3>
<p>A part of the museum is given over to an excellent reference library and
reading room. This library consists of books on archeology and related
natural history subjects pertaining to this interesting region. Visitors
have access to these books on application to the museum assistant who is
in charge. These books may not be removed from the reading room.</p>
<h2 id="c28"><br /><span class="small">FREE PUBLIC CAMP GROUNDS</span></h2>
<p>The new public camp grounds are located in the pi&ntilde;ons and junipers
on the rim of Spruce Canyon only a few hundred feet from Spruce Tree
Lodge and park headquarters. Individual party campsites have been
cleared, and a protecting screen of shrubbery contributes to their privacy.
Each site is provided with a fireplace, a table with seats, and a large level
place for a tent. Good water has been piped to convenient places, and
cut wood is provided without charge. Toilet facilities, showers, and
laundry tubs are also provided. A ranger is detailed for duty in the
camp grounds.</p>
<p><b>Leave your campsite clean when you have finished with it.</b></p>
<p><b>Do not drive cars on, or walk, over the shrubbery.</b></p>
<p>The camp ground facilities at Mesa Verde have been greatly improved
and expanded through the work of the Civilian Conservation Corps.</p>
<p>Provisions for campers are obtainable at reasonable prices in any of the
nearby towns. Groceries, gas, and oil can also be purchased at Spruce
Tree Lodge.</p>
<h2 id="c29"><br /><span class="small">HORSEBACK AND HIKING TRIPS</span></h2>
<p>Visitors who view the Mesa Verde from the automobile roads gain but
an inkling of the weird beauty and surprises that this area holds for the
more adventurous. Horseback and hiking trips along the rim rocks and
into the canyons lead to spectacular ruins not seen from any of the roads.
Such great ruins as Spring House, Long House, Kodak House, Jug House,
Mug House, and Step House, as well as all of the ruins in the more remote
canyons, can be reached by trail only. Each turn of the trail reveals
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
entrancing vistas of rugged canyons, sheer cliffs, great caves, hidden ruins,
distant mountains, tree-covered mesas, and open glades.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig9">
<img src="images/p038.jpg" alt="A party off for the less-frequented trails. Grant photo." width="500" height="380" />
<p class="center"><i><span class="small">A party off for the less-frequented trails. Grant photo.</span></i></p>
</div>
<p>In making these trips it is important that the hiker prepare himself
with proper footwear, as the trails are very precipitous in places.</p>
<h2 id="c30"><br /><span class="small">HOSPITAL AND MEDICAL SERVICE</span></h2>
<p>There is an excellent hospital at park headquarters where medical and
surgical service is provided to care for all emergency cases. Prices are
regulated by the Secretary of the Interior.</p>
<h2 id="c31"><br /><span class="small">ACCOMMODATIONS AND EXPENSES</span></h2>
<p>At Spruce Tree Lodge, situated among the pi&ntilde;ons and junipers overlooking
Spruce, Spruce Tree, and Navajo Canyons, cottages and comfortable
floored tents may be rented at prices ranging from $0.75 to $2 per
day a person for accommodations only, and from $4.50 to $5.75 per day
including meals. Meals, table d&rsquo;hote and a la carte, at reasonable prices.
Children: No charge under 3; half rates from 3 to 8. The official season
for Spruce Tree Lodge is from June 15 to September 15.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</div>
<p>The company also operates, for visitors who do not care to use their own
cars or are without private transportation, automobile service to various
ruins for $1 each, round trip. A special evening trip to Park Point to see
the spectacular sunset from the highest point in the park is $1.50 per person.</p>
<p class="center">OUT-OF-SEASON ACCOMMODATIONS</p>
<p>Before June 15 and after September 15, cabins may be rented from the
caretaker of Spruce Tree Lodge at the regular rates. Meals, with breakfast
50 cents, and luncheon and dinner 75 cents, may be had at the Government
dining hall. In nearby towns, less than an hour&rsquo;s drive from park
headquarters, accommodations are also obtainable.</p>
<p class="center">PACK AND SADDLE ACCOMMODATIONS</p>
<p>Saddle horses, especially trained for mountain work, may be rented
